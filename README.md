Assalamu Alaikum. 
Hope you are doing well. I tried to complete the given tasks as much as I could. I feel like I have completed all the tasks that were given, though if I had time I would've maybe added some more functionality or some 
more attributes and tests to further perfect it. But because of the time shortage plus it being Ramadan now, I couldn't. But still I hope that you like my submission and we get the chance to further know each other.
Any and every feedback is always welcome and appreciated! Thank you!
